# BlinkLED on STM32

This is a basic STM32CubeIDE project for blinking an LED on PA5 when the user button (PC13) is pressed.

## Features

- GPIO input (PC13)
- GPIO output (PA5)
- Debouncing via delay
- Basic use of HAL

## Hardware

- STM32F103C8T6 ("Blue Pill") board
- Buzzer and LED on breadboard

## Next Steps

- Add UART debugging
- Add PWM buzzer logic
- Expand into Smart Safe project
